    <h1>Recipe</h1>

    <p><i>Ingredients</i>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (227g) butter, to be browned</li>
        <li>1 cup (90g) Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
        <li>4oz (113g) dark or semisweet (60% cacao) chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant espresso (or 1 Tbsp instant coffee)</li>
        <li>1.5 cups (300g) white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vanilla</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (120g) flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp coarse kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Line 9x13” pan with foil or parchment paper with overhangs for easy removal.</li>
        <li>Put cocoa powder, chopped chocolate, and espresso powder in a heat-proof bowl.</li>
        <li>Make brown butter: Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium-low heat. Once foaming and spitting, stir and scrape bottom with a spatula every 10-15 seconds. Grainy white milk solids will begin to appear on the bottom. Continue for 5-10 minutes (go by senses, not time). When foam clears and spitting noises go silent, watch closely: The milk solids will toast in seconds. As soon as the solids turn brown and smell nutty, remove pan from heat so it doesn’t burn.</li>
        <li>Immediately pour hot brown butter into prepared bowl, to bloom cocoa and melt chocolate. Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>With a stand or hand mixer, whip sugars, vanilla, and eggs on medium-high until thick, smooth, fluffy, and lightened in color. For very moist, rich brownies, stop after 4-5 minutes. For slightly more height and fluff, whip 8-10 minutes until very thick and pale. </li>
        <li>Reduce speed to low. Slowly pour chocolate-butter mixture into egg foam mixture until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, fold in flour and salt until just incorporated. Fold in additional chocolate if using. Batter will be very thick.</li>
        <li>Scoop and spread batter evenly into prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake 25 minutes until surface is glossy and just set (not jiggly in center). Do not overbake. They will finish cooking as they cool.</li>
    </ol>
