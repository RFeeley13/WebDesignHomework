1. Request to server, server responds with content, and the browser receives the data over the network and interprets the response..  Browsers also have programming language interpreters and rendering engines to translate coding languages in order to display web pages.

2. 2. DOM, or “Document Object Model” is an object representation of the contents and data found in documents on the web. Nodes and other data points are interpreted by the engine for rendering. A render tree allows for web browsers to render each aspect of web pages per the document being referenced.
  
   3. 3. HTML is the most widely-used web language which is used to render content and page structure. XML acts as a compliment to HTML, describing document nodes, with uses in updating specific elements without refreshing a web page. However, as it does not render anything, it just provides tagged information wherein the author defines and structures individually. XHTML acts as a bridge between the other two, combining the best aspects of each. This allows for better usage across devices, such as mobile smartphones. However, it is a more time consuming language to utilize.
     
      4. 4. 4 necessary elements are DOCTYPE, root, head, and body.
        
         5. The Index is a master HTML file, acting as the homepage of a site. An index is found on the homepage of a website.
        
         6. 6. When naming files, do not use spaces or funky characters, and do not use numeric characters at the beginning of the name. You also need to include an extension with each file.
