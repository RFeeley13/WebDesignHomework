        <p> <b>ChatGPT:</b> I have been very reluctant to use anything AI related for schoolwork. However, it is hard to ignore the influence it has over
            college student right now. As I am looking for a topic to make this webpage about, I decided to put my first-ever inquiry into ChatGPT, as it seems like
            the most popular choice of people I know. So I am asking it "give me a few paragraphs about tortoises" and placing what it responds below. Due to the 
            nature of the program I would take whatever it says with a grain of salt. 
        </p>

        <p>
            "Tortoises, ancient creatures of remarkable resilience and slow-paced charm, have inhabited our planet for <i>millions</i> of years. These reptiles belong 
            to the family Testudinidae and are characterized by their hard, bony shells and terrestrial habitats. Found in various ecosystems across the globe, 
            from lush rainforests to arid deserts, tortoises have adapted to diverse environments, showcasing a fascinating array of species with unique traits.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most remarkable features of tortoises is their longevity. These creatures often outlive many other animals, with some species capable of 
            living well over a century. The Gal√°pagos tortoise holds the record as one of the longest-lived vertebrates, with individuals documented to have lived
             for more than 100 years in the wild. This exceptional lifespan is attributed to their slow metabolism, efficient use of resources, and the protection 
             provided by their sturdy shells, which shield them from predators and environmental hazards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tortoises are emblematic of patience and perseverance, moving at a deliberate pace that has become synonymous with steadiness and endurance. Despite 
            their sluggish gait, tortoises are skilled survivors, adapting to changes in their habitats and utilizing a range of strategies to thrive. Their 
            herbivorous diet, consisting primarily of vegetation, allows them to sustain themselves in environments where food may be scarce, while their ability 
            to dig burrows provides refuge from extreme temperatures and predators.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond their ecological significance, tortoises have also captured the human imagination, becoming symbols of wisdom, longevity, and resilience in various 
            cultures worldwide. From <span id="uppercase">Aesop's</span> fables to indigenous creation myths, these ancient reptiles have left an indelible mark on our collective consciousness, 
            reminding us of the enduring power of nature and the importance of coexistence with the creatures that share our planet."
        </p>

        <p>
            I am not really sure how to feel about what ChatGPT said about what I asked. It doesn't seem outright incorrect but it does feel very hollow and lacks <span id="character">character</span>.
