    <h1>Squat Exercise Variations</h1>

    <section>
        
        <div class="opening-paragraph">

            </div>
            The squat rack is one of the most important pieces of equipment for a proper resistance training leg day. 
            Loading up the bar with plates allows you to practice this compound movement to increase leg strength and 
            core stability. Compared to its variations, it is the best exercise for hitting multiple muscle groups without 
            isolation. Safety racks are necessary to perform this somewhat dangerous movement, however, as loading up too 
            much weight can lead to injury very quickly.

        <div class="second-paragraph">
            <div class="smithmachine">
                <img alt="smithmachine">
            </div>
            The smith machine is a squat rack variation that allows for safer racking of the bar using hooks and clips 
            attached to it. This variation can allow users to reach a deeper movement in their squat while also loading 
            up more weight on the bar with confidence due to the safety hooks. It is a more isolating movement compared 
            to the squat due to this, however, as it does not force your core stability to activate like the normal 
            unassisted squat rack does.

        <div class="third-paragraph">
            <div class="legpress">
                <img alt="legpress">
            </div>
            The leg press is a machine with many different variations. The incline seated variation is the one I am 
            most familiar with, and it allows for me to move the greatest amoount of weight compared to the other 
            variations listed on this website. Due to this, it also has the most relative isolation, mainly targeting 
            the glutes and quads with correct form. I would argue that it has the potential to be the safest out of 
            the three variations when using the same amount of weight for each.
